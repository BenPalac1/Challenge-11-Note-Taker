# 11-Take-Note-Taker
Express.js Challenge

## Description
    This repo contains Take-Note-Taker. This application can be used to write and save notes.  By using Express.js on the back end, the app can save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

    The front end was already create for me though my bootcamp and I was cahrged with building the back end, connecting it to the pre-existing front, and deploying the whole app to Heroku.


## User Story
AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save button

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
